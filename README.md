**ATTENTION: Very alpha source code!**

## SVNovo is a free multiplatform GUI for SVN client 

SVNovo aims to a simple but complete SVN GUI client. It's based on the user experience of [RapidSVN](http://rapidsvn.org/).

It's developed in [FreePascal](http://freepascal.org/) using [Lazarus](http://www.lazarus-ide.org/).
When ready it will be available at least for Windows and Linux. Sorry but I don't own a Mac, although a porting should be very easy...
